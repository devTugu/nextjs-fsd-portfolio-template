## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

1. Open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/devTugu/nextjs-fsd-portfolio-template/security/advisories/new) on this repository, or email the maintainer listed in the repository profile.
2. Include steps to reproduce, impact, and affected routes or components.
3. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure.

## Secrets

- Never commit `.env`, `.env.local`, API keys, or JWT secrets.
- Use `API_INTERNAL_URL` server-side only (BFF); do not expose the NestJS API directly to browsers in production.
- Rotate `JWT_*` secrets and seed passwords before any public deployment.

## More detail

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for BFF cookies, CSRF, MFA, and production hardening.
